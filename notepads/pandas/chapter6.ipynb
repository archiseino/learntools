    "When performing operations on a dataset, we will sometimes need to combine different DataFrames and/or Series in non-trivial ways. Pandas has three core methods for doing this. In order of increasing complexity, these are `concat()`, `join()`, and `merge()`. Most of what `merge()` can do can also be done more simply with join(), so we will omit it and focus on the first two functions here.\n",
