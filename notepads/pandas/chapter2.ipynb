    "### Indexing in Pandas\n",
    "There are two ways of accessing index in pandas, such as `loc` and `iloc`\n",

    "#### Index-based locations (iloc)\n",
    "`iloc` works based on the numerical position in the data. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "reviews.iloc[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will give the detail description of the item in index 0.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Label-based selection (loc)\n",
    "Second paradigm for selection is by `loc`. In this paradigm, it's the data index value not its position, which matters.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "reviews.loc[0, \"country\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "`iloc` is conceptually simpler than `loc` because it ignores the dataset's indices. When we use iloc we treat the dataset like a big matrix (a list of lists), one that we have to index into by position. loc, by contrast, uses the information in the indices to do its work. Since your dataset usually has meaningful indices, it's usually easier to do things using loc instead.`"

    "### Choosing Loc and Iloc\n",
    "iloc uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. So 0:10 will select entries 0,...,9. loc, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So 0:10 will select entries 0,...,10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the change? Remember that loc can index any stdlib type: strings, for example. If we have a DataFrame with index values Apples, ..., Potatoes, ..., and we want to select \"all the alphabetical fruit choices between Apples and Potatoes\", then it's a lot more convenient to index df.loc['Apples':'Potatoes'] than it is to index something like df.loc['Apples', 'Potatoet'] (t coming after s in the alphabet)."
