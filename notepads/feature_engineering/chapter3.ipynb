    "- Understand the features. Refer to your dataset's data documentation, if available.\n",
    "- Research the problem domain to acquire domain knowledge. If your problem is predicting house prices, do some research on real-estate for instance. Wikipedia can be a good starting point, but books and journal articles will often have the best information.\n",
    "- Study previous work. Solution write-ups from past Kaggle competitions are a great resource.\n",
    "- Use data visualization. Visualization can reveal pathologies in the distribution of a feature or complicated relationships that could be simplified. Be sure to visualize your dataset as you work through the feature engineering process.\n"

    "- It's good to keep in mind your model's own strengths and weaknesses when creating features. Here are some guidelines:\n",
    "- Linear models learn sums and differences naturally, but can't learn anything more complex.\n",
    "- Ratios seem to be difficult for most models to learn. Ratio combinations often lead to some easy performance gains.\n",
    "- Linear models and neural nets generally do better with normalized features. Neural nets especially need features scaled to values not too far from 0. Tree-based models (like random forests and XGBoost) can sometimes benefit from normalization, but usually much less so.\n",
    "- Tree models can learn to approximate almost any combination of features, but when a combination is especially important they can still benefit from having it explicitly created, especially when data is limited.\n",
    "- Counts are especially helpful for tree models, since these models don't have a natural way of aggregating information across many features at once.\n"
